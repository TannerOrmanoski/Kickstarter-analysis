This analysis is specfically aimed at aiding Louise discover the best way to ensure her play, "Fever," reaches it's fundrasing goal.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Launch Date
Part of my analysis was focused on the timing of the campaigns, more specically if their was a correlation between the start date of a campaign and the campaigns outcome. Through the use of a line graph (picured below) I have come to the conclusion that campaigns that start in May and June are most successful.

### Analysis Based on Goals
Another thing that I analyzed was the how the goal amount affected the outcomes of the campaigns. After using measures of central tendency, I found that the mean goal of successful campaigns was half that of failed campaigns. I further used a line chart to visualize the how the campaign outcomes were affected by the goal amount. This showed that the percentage of failed campaigns slowly increased as the goal amount went up, but it started to decrease at $25,000 and then sharply increased again at $40,000, only to begin another decline at $45,000.
