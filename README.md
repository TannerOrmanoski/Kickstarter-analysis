# Kickstarter-analysis
Analysis preformed on Kickstarter data to observe trends.
## Findings
Throughout my analysis various trends were uncovered. The first trend, is that theater was the most successful category in Great Britian. Out of the 604 campaigns in Britian we can determine that theater campaigns garnered the most support and theafore reached their monetary goals most often. Another important trend has to do with the timming of the campaigns. Through use of a line chart it is gleaned that May and June campaigns see much greater success. A great exmaple of a successful theater campaign  in Great Britian is the play "Foresight." After taking a more direct look at this play's campaign, I discovered that it not only surpassed it's goal, but it also attracted relatively high individual donations.
