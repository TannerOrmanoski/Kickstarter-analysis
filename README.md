This analysis is specfically aimed at aiding Louise discover the best way to ensure her play, "Fever," reaches it's fundrasing goal.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Launch Date
Part of my analysis was focused on the timing of the campaigns, more specically if their was a correlation between the start date of a campaign and the campaigns outcome. Through the use of a line graph (picured below) I have come to the conclusion that campaigns that start in May and June are most successful. 
### Analysis Based on Goals
Throughout my analysis various trends were uncovered. The first trend, is that theater was the most successful category in Great Britian. Out of the 604 campaigns in Britian we can determine that theater campaigns garnered the most support and theafore reached their monetary goals most often. Another important trend has to do with the timming of the campaigns. Through use of a line chart it is gleaned that May and June campaigns see much greater success. A great exmaple of a successful theater campaign  in Great Britian is the play "Foresight." After taking a more direct look at this play's campaign, I discovered that it not only surpassed it's goal, but it also attracted relatively high individual donations.
