# Kickstarter-analysis
## Analysis preformed on Kickstarter data to observe trends.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to comb through and analyze Kickstarter data in order to find relevant trends and suggestions. The resulting proposed suggestions will help guide future Kickstarter endeavors. This analysis is specifically aimed at aiding Louise in discovering the best way to ensure her play, "Fever," reaches its fundraising goal.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Launch Date
Part of my analysis was focused on the timing of the campaigns, more specifically, if there was a correlation between the start date of a campaign and the campaign's outcome. Using the line graph (pictured below), I came to the conclusion that campaigns that start in May and June are most successful.

### Analysis Based on Goals
Another aspect that I analyzed was how the goal amount affected the outcomes of the campaigns. After using measures of central tendency, I found that the mean goal of successful campaigns was half that of failed campaigns. I further used a line chart to visualize how the campaign outcomes were affected by the goal amount. This showed that the percentage of failed campaigns slowly increased as the goal amount went up, but started to decrease at $25,000 and then sharply increased again at $40,000, only to begin another decline at $45,000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenges I faced in my analysis were few, but present nonetheless. The most obvious challenge was the shear amount of the data. The overwhelming amount data made it difficult to conceptualize what story the data was trying to tell. I was also challenged when trying to appropriately format the data in order to increase readability. Formatting the data was where most of my time was spent, and it proved to be rather tedious. Another major challenge was found in drawing conclusions from looking at the goal amounts. While the central tendency measures pointed to one conclusion, the line chart was rather inconclusive.
## Results
- From the Outcomes based on Launch Date graph, I concluded that the best time to launch a campaign is in May or June. I concluded that the worst time to a launch a campaign is October through December.
- The Outcomes based on Goals chart showed that, for the most part, more modest goal amounts lead to more successful campaigns. This assumption holds true up to $35,000, where the percentage of failed campaigns decreases and then continues to increase again at $40,000. 
- The limitations of this dataset have a lot to do with the fact that this data cannot gage things such as the marketing of the various campaigns or the networks of the people starting the campaigns. These two factors can tremendously help a campaign achieve its goals. If we could understand if certain campaigns are being promoted through advertisements or social media, we could see if successful campaigns are successful due to good promotion and if so, what types of promotion are most effective.
- There are other tables and graphs that might have helped us understand the data. It would be interesting to have a chart that displayed frequently used words in the blurb of the campaigns. This could help point out possible similarities in successful campaigns. Another graph could have been used to chart campaign outcomes and their deadlines, or the duration of the campaigns and their outcomes. We could see if the deadline has any significant effect or if longer or shorter campaigns lead to more success. A final idea would be graphing the outcomes of different countries in order to determine if some countries harbor more successful campaigns than others.
