# Kickstarter-analysis
##Analysis preformed on Kickstarter data to observe trends.
###Purpose
This purpose of this project is to comb and analyze Kickstarter data to find relevant trends and suggestions. The proposed suggestions will help guide future kickstarter endevors. This analysis is specfically aimed at aiding Louise discover the best way to ensure her play, "Fever," reaches it's fundrasing goal.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Launch Date
Part of my analysis was focused on the timing of the campaigns, more specically if there was a correlation between the start date of a campaign and the campaign's outcome. Through the use of a line graph (picured below) I have come to the conclusion that campaigns that start in May and June are most successful.

### Analysis Based on Goals
Another thing that I analyzed was the how the goal amount affected the outcomes of the campaigns. After using measures of central tendency, I found that the mean goal of successful campaigns was half that of failed campaigns. I further used a line chart to visualize the how the campaign outcomes were affected by the goal amount. This showed that the percentage of failed campaigns slowly increased as the goal amount went up, but it started to decrease at $25,000 and then sharply increased again at $40,000, only to begin another decline at $45,000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenges I faced in my analysis were few, but present nontheless. The most obvious challenge was the shear amount of the data. The overwhelming amount data made it difficult to conceptualize what story the data was trying to tell. I was also challenged when trying to appropriatly format the data in order to increase readability. Formatting the data is where most of my time was spent, and proved to be rather tedioius. Another major challenge was found in drawing conclusions from looking at the goal amounts. While the central tendency measures pointed to one conculision, the line chart was rather inconclusive.
## Results
- From the Outcomes based on Launch Date graph, I can conclude that the best time to launch a campaign is in May or June. I can also conclude that the worst time to a launch a campaign is October through December.
- The Outcomes based on Goals chart shows that, for the most part, more modest goal amounts leads to more successful campaigns. This assumption holds true up to $35,000, where the percentage of failed campaigns decreases and then continues to increase again at $40,000. 
- The limitaions of this dataset have a lot to do with the fact that this data cannot gage the
